# AEStolfo's Roblox Client Optimizer

ARCO tweaks FFlags to optimize your Roblox client.

## About ARCO
Some things ARCO currently does:
- Unlocks FPS
- Optimizes Caching
- Optimizes Graphics
- Optimizes Textures
- Increases user privacy
- Disables Crashpad / Backtrace crash metrics
- Disables a large portion of client telemetry
- Disables AbuseReportScreenshot
- Enables font and texture item preloading
- Enables FULL graphics quality options (21 instead of 10!)
- Enables BatchAssetApi

Some things I am planning for the project:
- Enabling QuickGameLaunch (like RCO™ 2)
- Auto updater (like RCO™ 2)
- Automatic installation (like the original)

## Installation
See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY7US2Zl47M) for information on how to install the flags manually, but keep in mind to use this repository instead.

I, AEStolfo, have made a separate project based on the amazing work by [OptiFury](https://www.optifury.com): [Roblox Client Optimizer™](https://rco.simulhost.com/). Please do not sue me, as I'm planning on creating big additions.
